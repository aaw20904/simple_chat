/*# reason: Improvement of auto-reconnect client to server.
The software isn`t working correctly  */

a) The last parameter of the class 'WebSocketConnectionManager' will not uses at all - because 
 the websocket server will run apart from a HTTP server.
b) When the client tries to connect to WS - 
the event 'upgrade' appears on the  http server. Then the event handler of the http server process client`s data 
(cookies for authentication) and if neccessary runs callbacks on webSocket instance
for authorization.
c) Then the http server calls websocket`s method 'handleUpgrade()' with the callback.
This calback  in turn calls websocket`s 'emit(`connection`, , )'  method.
                    *   *   *
SHORTLY: add method 'initWsCallback(req, socket, head)' on the class 'WebSocketConnectionManager',
 ths method calls by the HTTPS server.
